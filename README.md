### Me

Hello, I'm Jorun. Also known as a64s or amd64sucks.

I'm a 21-year-old student with a passion for emulation, reverse engineering, and operating system development. I'm particularly interested in the Rust programming language and have experience with C, C++, Rust, Assembly (x86, x86_64, and some aarch64), and Typescript.

I don't yet have any experience as a professional. These things take time :)
