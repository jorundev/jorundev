### Me

Hello, I'm Jorun. Also known as a64s or amd64sucks.

I'm a french 21-year-old student with a passion for emulation, reverse engineering, and operating system development. I'm particularly interested in the Rust programming language and have experience with C, C++, Rust, Assembly (x86, x86_64, aarch64, and a bit of MIPS), and JS/Typescript.

I also do webdev. I got experience with Svelte(Kit) and a bit of PHP Symfony.

I don't yet have any experience as a professional
